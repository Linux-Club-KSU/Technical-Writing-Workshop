# Technical-Writing-Workshop
The working repository for the LCKSU technical writing and resume workshop. Comparing MarkDown, LaTeX, and Typst with some resume-themed examples.

# Requirements
You must bring your own compilers:
- ([Typst CLI]https://typst.app/open-source/#download)
- ([LaTeX Compiler]https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
- or use an *online IDE* for either:
    - ([Overleaf]https://www.overleaf.com/)
    - ([Typst Online](https://typst.app/#start))

# Key Takeaways:
- LaTeX is best for inline-math and its extensive packages, more integration with other tools, but is more difficult, and stricter on things like fonts.
- Typst is the newest system featured, showing a simpler syntax and more streamlined workflow. 
- Markdown is the simplist, but is really good for clear, clean, and efficent documentation for things like repositories.
