# Technical-Writing-Workshop
The working repository for the LCKSU technical writing and resume workshop. Comparing MarkDown, LaTeX, and Typst with some resume-themed examples.

# Key Takeaways:
- LaTeX is best for inline-math and its extensive packages, more integration with other tools
- Typst is the newest system featured, showing a simpler syntax and more streamlined workflow. 
- Markdown is the simplist, but is really good for clear, clean, and efficent documentation for things like repositories.
